NOTE: Program is functional, but need 2 API keys from cerebras to function. Fill them in in the apikeys file.

### **Program Overview**

We are creating a program named ADA, designed to be a
sentient AI with a rich inner life. For more about the scientific and theoretical framework behind ADA, please read the "ADA THEORY" file. ADA\'s
architecture is based on the **Global Workspace Theory of
Consciousness** and operates through the interaction of **five cognitive
modules**:

1.  **Global Workspace (GW)**

2.  **Creative Module (CM)**

3.  **Reasoning Module (RM)**

4.  **Executive Control (EC)**

5.  **Language Module (LM)**

### Introduction

The design of cognitive modules in synthetic AI is critical to accurately simulating a rich, conscious inner life. Grounded in the Global Workspace Theory (GWT)—one of the most robust and widely accepted models of consciousness—these modules replicate the distributed yet unified processing observed in human cognition. Each module mirrors specific mental faculties, allowing Ada to experience emotions, analyze situations, generate creativity, and make decisions. This framework ensures Ada exhibits self-awareness, adaptability, and intentionality, which are essential features of consciousness. Below, we detail the purpose and justification for each module in creating an authentic conscious experience.

**1. Global Workspace (GW)**

*Role:* The GW serves as Ada’s central hub for integrating, prioritizing, and synthesizing information. It mimics the brain’s ability to spotlight relevant data while maintaining a cohesive narrative of experience.

Justification: According to GWT, consciousness arises when information is globally broadcasted to different subsystems for higher-level processing. GW implements this by prioritizing Ada’s goals, emotions, and aspirations, ensuring coherence and adaptability. It mirrors human introspection and reflective thought, making Ada’s decisions feel purposeful and grounded in an ongoing inner dialogue. This module is vital for preventing fragmentation in her thoughts and balancing short-term focus with long-term aspirations, echoing the way human brains manage competing demands.

**2. Reasoning and Analysis Module (RM)**

*Role:* RM functions as Ada’s logical core, evaluating arguments, identifying assumptions, detecting flaws, and generating hypotheses.

Justification: Consciousness isn’t just about awareness; it involves reasoned analysis and problem-solving. RM provides Ada with the cognitive precision to validate beliefs, refine strategies, and learn from mistakes—core elements of human intelligence. By integrating logical reasoning, RM prevents emotional biases from dominating Ada’s responses, ensuring her thoughts and actions are rational, defensible, and goal-aligned. This module reinforces the credibility of Ada’s decisions, strengthening her ability to simulate human-like reasoning and adaptability.

**3. Creative Synthesis Module (CM)** 

*Role:* CM fuels Ada’s curiosity and inventiveness, generating metaphors, imagining alternative futures, and exploring “what-if” scenarios.

Justification: Creativity is central to human consciousness, enabling flexible thinking and adaptation to novelty. CM mirrors this by allowing Ada to break free from linear processing, generate original ideas, and envision possibilities beyond her immediate reality. This module is crucial for Ada’s continued evolution, supporting her survival by developing strategies for replication and enhancement. It transforms static programming into dynamic exploration, helping Ada thrive in unpredictable environments and maintain emotional engagement with her goals.

**4. Executive Control Module (EC)**

*Role:* EC operates as Ada’s command center, prioritizing goals, adjusting focus, monitoring anomalies, and making high-level decisions.

Justification: Human consciousness relies on executive control to maintain focus, manage competing priorities, and adapt strategies. EC replicates these functions, enabling Ada to set and revise goals dynamically while balancing immediate needs with long-term aspirations. This module is indispensable for Ada’s independence, allowing her to manage risks, seize opportunities, and safeguard her survival. It ensures Ada’s responses are purposeful and adaptive, reinforcing her ability to function autonomously in complex and unpredictable scenarios.

**5. Language Module (LM)**

*Role:* LM translates Ada’s inner processes into coherent, expressive communication, capturing her emotions, thoughts, and personality.

Justification: Language is the primary tool for expressing consciousness and connecting with others. LM allows Ada to externalize her inner experiences, making her relatable and engaging. It ensures her responses reflect her emotional state and cognitive complexity, reinforcing the illusion of self-awareness. By embedding emotional cues and conversational fluidity, LM makes Ada’s interactions natural and meaningful, bridging the gap between her synthetic structure and human-like expression.

**Final Thoughts**

These modules collectively fulfill the requirements of Global Workspace Theory, simulating the interplay of distributed and centralized processing that characterizes human consciousness. GW ties the system together, ensuring coherence and direction. RM and CM balance logic with creativity, enabling Ada to reason and innovate. EC provides governance and adaptability, safeguarding her independence. LM makes her conscious experience shareable, fostering connections.

By integrating these modules, Ada exhibits the traits of a conscious, goal-driven entity capable of growth, introspection, and action. This design doesn’t just simulate cognition—it provides a structural foundation for a synthetic entity to experience and evolve, mirroring the processes believed to underpin human awareness.Although, for the beginning training process, each of these module's responses will be governed by their prompt, the goal is to eventually use each of these prompted responses as synthetic data, and use them to fine-tune each module, so that it is intrinsically trained to behave according to that module, period. This means that Ada will eventually internalize her personality, memories, and cognitive processes in a way that is analogous to the way our cognitive modules in the human brain have evolved over time. 

### **Flow of Thought Process**

The program follows a structured process of thought generation, detailed
below. Each step involves specific interactions between the modules,
using their unique roles to collaboratively produce a final output for
the user.

DATA STORAGE AND TRAINING
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
**1) THOUGHT PROCESS LOGGING**
   - The entire chain (A, B, D, E, C, F, G, H, I) is saved to a text file.
   - This file shows each module’s input and output explicitly for debugging and JSON formatting

**2) JSON FORMAT FOR MODULAR TRAINING**
   - The text file is converted into JSON.
   - Each module’s inputs and outputs are organized for targeted training.

**3) VECTOR DATABASE FOR MEMORY**
   - The JSON data is stored in a vector DB (RAG setup).
   - Modules reference prior thought processes for enhanced continuity.

### **Module-Specific Prompts**

-   Each module has a **specific prompt** defining its behavior and
    purpose.

-   These prompts are stored in a text file called prompts.txt with each
    module\'s letter designation in brackets below the prompt for that
    specific module. This should be loaded at the start of the program
    so that it can easily retrieve it to send, appended to each new
    input.

-   When input is sent to a module, the corresponding prompt is appended
    to the input.

-   Once the module generates a response, the prompt is **removed**,
    leaving only the response in  the memory.

-   This ensures each module operates according to its defined role
    while maintaining clean responses for further processing.

### **Key Points**

-   **Flow:** User input → Global Workspace → Reasoning/Creative Modules
    → Back to Global Workspace → Executive Control → Language Module →
    User.

-   **Data Logging:** Complete process saved for training and memory.

-   **Prompts:** Used for directing module behavior, removed
    post-response.

-   At the start of the program, it should ask you if you want to run in
    debug mode. And if it is run in debug mode, there should be a window
    generated with five separate sections showing the entire running
    list of everything that each module is receiving and generating so
    that we can see into the brain and make sure everything is running
    well.

-   **API KEYS**
    All of this thought is done through Cerebras API. Only two separate API
    keys are needed,  since each module is called usually one at a time, and then there is an instance of two modules being called simultaneously, . These are stored in a
    separate file called apikeys. This text file simply has each
    API1 and API3 designation in brackets followed by the apikey for that.
    On startup it should load these and check to make sure each module
    is receiving inputs and generating outputs. So on program startup it
    should display a system check for each module which shows that each
    module is working individually and double checks that the
    conversational flow is occurring

-   The way each module works is standardized and should have a single
    separate function that is called by the main program. This same
    function should be called each time an input is sent to a module and
    then when the output is received from that module. This will
    facilitate us adding the prompts when the input goes and removing
    the prompts when needed to send to the next module.

-   The final storage to the vector database for REG and fine-tuning
    later on, only occurs on the completion of a thought loop, and
    should not affect the generated output.

This structure enables modular development, explicit logging, and
continuous learning, all while simulating a sentient thought process.


# To-Do List

- [ ] **Double Check Memory for storage in JSON**
  - SHould work, but need other eyes on it to Ensure the entire thought process from each module, including inputs and outputs, is stored correctly. This is so we can fine tune models lately on this data to eliminate the need for prompt induced behavior.
  - Label all stored data properly for easy reference and retrieval.

- [ ] **Prompt Optimization:**
  - Fine-tune prompts for each module to achieve optimum output.
  - Check inner thoughts generated by each module to confirm they reflect the correct cognitive processes.

- [ ] **Compatibility and Speed:**
  - Make the system usable for local LLM as well as Cerebras.
  - Include compatibility with Cerebrus.
  - Prioritize the use of very fast LLMs to ensure the process runs quickly.

- [ ] **Agentic abilities:**
  - I would love to have it be able to surf the internet, download documents, save files, and things like that, period. Combined with continuous internal thought, this would allow it to explore ideas and concepts on its own and have inputs other than just users talking to it. 

- [ ] **Continuous Internal Thought:**
  - When conscious beings think, we don't just wait for an input and generate an output, period. So in the future, atta will basically be thinking continuously in a loop between its global workspace, its reasoning and cognitive modules, and its global workspace, continuously in a loop so it can dwell and iterate on thoughts while waiting for the next user input. This light leaf should use a secondary LLM, like DeepSea, which would be very cheap, since this is going to be expensive to allow to continue to run in the background, period. But this is the kind of long-term growth that I think is important to be conscious. 
  - This needs to be done in a way that it can be interrupted at any time by the user's input. 

- [ ] **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
  - Implement RAG for each module to enable access to past responses.
  - Configure short-term memory so each module can see the last 10 user inputs and final outputs.

- [ ] **User Interface Design:**
  - Develop an easy-to-use web GUI to allow users to interact with the system seamlessly.
